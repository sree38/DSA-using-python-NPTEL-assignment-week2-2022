# One of the following 10 statements generates an error. Which one? (Your answer should be a number between 1 and 10.)

x = [[3,5],"mimsy",2,"borogove",1]  # Statement 1

y = x[0:50]                          # Statement 2

z = y                                # Statement 3

w = x                                # Statement 4

x[1] = x[1][:5] + 'ery'              # Statement 5

y[1] = 4                             # Statement 6

w[1][:3] = 'fea'                     # Statement 7

z[4] = 42                            # Statement 8

x[0][0] = 5555                       # Statement 9

a = (x[3][1] == 1)                   # Statement 10

Answer : THe error is at line no 7

# Consider the following lines of Python code.

b = [43,99,65,105,4]

a = b[2:]

d = b[1:]

c = b

d[1] = 95


b[2] = 47

c[3] = 73

Answer :  a[0] == 65, b[3] == 73, c[3] == 73, d[1] == 95


# What is the value of endmsg after executing the following lines?

startmsg = "anaconda"

endmsg = ""

for i in range(1,1+len(startmsg)):

endmsg = endmsg + startmsg[-i]

Answer : "adnocana"

# What is the value of mylist after the following lines are executed?

def mystery(l):
